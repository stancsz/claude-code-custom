Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster by executing routine tasks, explaining complex code, and handling git workflows -- all through natural language commands. Use it in your terminal, IDE, or tag @claude on Github.

**Learn more in the [official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)**.

## LiteLLM Integration

You can use [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/) to proxy Claude Code requests to other LLMs (e.g. OpenAI, Azure, LOCAL, etc).

1. Ensure you have rebuilt the devcontainer to install LiteLLM.
2. Provide your API keys as environment variables in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or export them in your shell.
3. Start the LiteLLM proxy:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start-litellm.sh [target_model]
   # Example: ./scripts/start-litellm.sh gpt-5.1-codex
   ```
4. The `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` is pre-configured with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/anthropic` to route requests to the proxy.
